# Claude Certified Architect — Foundations Trainer

A single-user study app for the **Claude Certified Architect (CCA) Foundations**
exam. Walks all five exam domains chapter by chapter, each with the same ladder:

1. **Explain like I'm 5** — the intuition.
2. **The real deal** — the actual engineering, edge cases, and exam traps.
3. **Quick checks** — fast concept questions.
4. **Scenario questions** — 10+ exam-style scenarios per chapter, scored to the 720 line.

Plus a **Mixed exam** that pulls ten scenarios at random across every domain.

Progress (studied chapters, answers, graded state, per-chapter best scores,
best mixed score) is stored **locally in your browser** via `localStorage` —
no account, no server-side state. Export / import / reset live in the sidebar.

## Run it

### Docker (nothing to install but Docker)

```bash
docker compose up
# open http://localhost:8080
docker compose down   # stop
```

### Python fallback (no Docker)

```bash
python3 serve.py --open      # http://localhost:8080
```

> The app uses ES modules, which the browser refuses to load over `file://`.
> Use one of the servers above rather than double-clicking `index.html`.

## Adding content

- **A new question** → append to the chapter's array in `js/data/extra-more.js`
  (or `extra.js`). Shape: `{ q, options:[…4…], correct, why, traps:{…} }`.
  The app shuffles option order per question (deterministically from a stored
  seed), so author with `correct` pointing at the right option in its
  authored position.
- **A new chapter** → add an entry to `js/data/topics.js` and list its id under
  the right domain in `js/data/domains.js`.

## Scoring

Each scenario set and the mixed exam scale `correct/total` to a 1000-point
scale; **720** is the pass line, mirroring the real exam.
